<!-- This file defines the D-Bus interface for a simple object, that
     will hold a simple state consisting of two values (one a 32-bit
     integer, the other a double).

     The object will always generate a signal when a value is changed
     (changed_value1 or changed_value2).

     It has also a min and max thresholds: when a client tries to
     set the value too high or too low, the object will generate a
     signal (outofrange_value1 or outofrange_value2).

     The thresholds are not modifiable (nor viewable) via this
     interface. They are specified in integers and apply to both
     internal values. Adding per-value thresholds would be a good
     idea. Generalizing the whole interface to support multiple
     concurrent values would be another good idea.

     The interface name is "org.maemo.Value".
     One known reference implementation is provided for it by the
     "/GlobalValue" object found via a well-known name of
     "org.maemo.Platdev_ex". -->
